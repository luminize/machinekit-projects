# Machinekit Projects

The aim of this repository is to bring order in the
Machinekit project by gatherering issues and (ongoing)
(sub) projects.

This repo *will* contain different files written in Asciidoc
so that generating documents and visualising diagrams can
be done in an easy way.

Tools:
- Asciidoctor
- Asciidoctor-diagram
- Asciidoctor-pdf
- IDE with proper Asciidoctor preview capabilities.

One of such is Microsoft Visual Code, where the Asciidoctor
plugin can generate correct output in a live preview window.
This IDE is not mandatory, but has proven to work quite well
with writing these documents.

This repo _will not_ contain code, nor will it be a substitute
for the Machinekit documentation.
